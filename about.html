          <p>Christi Brock is a lifelong Henry County advocate and a candidate for Henry County Prosecutor in the May 2026 Republican primary. She graduated from New Castle High School in 1993, returned home with her husband Mark to raise their family, and has built her legal career around serving local residents.</p>
          <p>Christi spent 10 years in the Henry County Prosecutor's Office, where she partnered closely with law enforcement on drug cases, sex crimes, and juvenile matters. She is the only current candidate who has successfully prosecuted a Level 1 felony jury trial in Henry County within the last five years.</p>
          <p>Today, she works at DeFur Voran on Broad Street, focusing on civil litigation, guardian ad litem work, estate planning, and municipal law. Her service continues through the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT), CASA, and the Red-Tail Land Conservancy board.</p>
          <p>Her campaign is built on practical leadership, accountability, and a clear mission: protect families, support victims, and seek justice with integrity.</p>
