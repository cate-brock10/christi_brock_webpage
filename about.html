          <p>Christi Brock is a lifelong Henry County advocate and a candidate for Henry County Prosecutor in the May 5th Republican primary. She grew up in New Castle, where her dad, Dave Copenhaver, practiced law, and her mom, Carrie Copenhaver, taught elementary school. She spent several summers working at Summit Lake State Park during high school and college. Christi graduated from New Castle High School in 1993, attended Purdue University, and returned to Henry County with her husband, Mark, GM of Grede Foundry, to build a home and raise their two children, Cate and Ben. She has since built her legal career around serving local residents.</p>
          <p>Christi spent 10 years in the Henry County Prosecutor's Office, where she partnered closely with law enforcement on all manner of cases, including drug cases, sex crimes, and juvenile matters. Today she works at DeFur Voran on Broad Street, focusing on civil litigation, guardian ad litem work, estate planning, and municipal law.</p>
          <p>Her service to her community continues through pro bono representation of non-profits and people in need, membership in CIT (an initiative working towards improving law enforcement's response to the mental health crisis), and advocacy for abused and neglected children as a CASA volunteer. She also managed a $3-million capital campaign to restore the Baker Park Aquatic Center.</p>
          <p>Her campaign is built on practical leadership, accountability, and a clear mission: protect families, support victims, and seek justice with integrity.</p>
