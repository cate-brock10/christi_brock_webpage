## Goal
Build a simple, fast, accessible campaign website (mobile-first) with:
- Home
- About
- Issues
- Yard Sign Request (signup form)
- Social media
- Contact

## Requirements
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, good contrast, keyboard navigation
- Performance: no heavy frameworks unless necessary
- Privacy: no third-party trackers by default
- Copy tone: friendly, local, action-oriented; avoid jargon

## Workflow
- Keep changes small and easy to review
- After edits, run a local preview command and report the URL/steps
